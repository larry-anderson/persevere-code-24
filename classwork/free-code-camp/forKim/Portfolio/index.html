                <p>This was a fun procject. It was step by step so it's not my own design, but i really liked the way it
                    turned out.</p>

                <p>This is a project i did in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, but it wasn't a step by step. I had to use my own ideas with
                    the perameters that were set. I went above and beyond to make this page look good, because it was
                    about my teacher in the <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.perseverenow.org/">Persevere Program</a>, Ms. Tiana
                    Turman.</p>

        <p>My daddy always told me that "if you ain't got nothin nice to saw don't say nothin' at all." With that being said there's not a lot to say about myself. I've done some bad things in my life. I've struggled with addiction ever since i was a kid. I ended up going to prison because of it, but I've come out better for it on the other end. I've turned my life around. I have a job that i work everyday. I'm Taking classes with the  <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.perseverenow.org/">Persevere Program</a>. I have also been building a better relationship with my family. I'm determined to make something of myself, so I can have "something to say."</p>
